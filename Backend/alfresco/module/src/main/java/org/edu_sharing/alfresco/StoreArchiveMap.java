/**
 * 
 * 
 * This class is used for disabling Archiving for the whole repository
 * the cause is:
 * queryChildren delivers also archived Nodes, this causes errors in CC Alfresco access Classes when 
 * trying to accessg an deleted Node with the wrong Store
 * 
 * 120109: When is an Archived node created:
 * an node will be archived when it's linked in Folder B and the primary parent is folder A and the node is deleted in folder A.
 * Than an archived Node appears in Folder B. Why there is no archived node in Folder A, I don't know.
 * 
 * also we don't want to get deleted Nodes
 * 
 * another cause is the Performance when calling queryChildren delivers also the deleted Nodes.
 * we didn't found an possibility for configuring the repositoryService to not deliver archived Nodes
 * 
 * this class overwrites the bean with the id storeArchiveMap in the file /alfresco/extension/custom-repository-context.xml
 * org.alfresco.repo.node.StoreArchiveMap
 * 
 * another possibility would be to add the sys:temporary aspect to the our types so they would not be archived
 * 
 * But with overwriting this bean we got an global switch for enabling/diabling archiving for all nodes
 * 
 * http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Disabling_Document_Archival
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * This class simply does nothing
